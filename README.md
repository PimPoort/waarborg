# Honesty Bar Coffee Guide

This project provides a simple kiosk-style web page for an honesty bar coffee stand. The page displays different types of coffee. When a coffee is selected, a short video demonstrates how to make it.

## Usage

1. Place your tutorial videos in the `videos/` directory and name them as referenced in `index.html` (e.g., `espresso.mp4`, `cappuccino.mp4`, `latte.mp4`).
2. Open `index.html` in a browser on the tablet.
3. For a true kiosk experience, configure the tablet to open the page in full-screen or kiosk mode (e.g., using Chrome's `--kiosk` flag on Android or by using a dedicated kiosk app).

The tablet should be locked to this application so customers can only watch the coffee tutorials.
